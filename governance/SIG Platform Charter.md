# SIG PLATFORM Charter 

This charter adheres to the Roles and Organization Management specified in "<sig-governance.md>".

Team information may be found in the "<readme.md>"

# Overview of SIG

Sets the standards and practices for maintenance and development on cross-platform features.


# Goals

- Major goals that SIG seeks to generally achieve

# Scope 

## In scope 

* Define platforms supported.
* Define how the Platform Abstraction Layer works
* Define structuring of codebase for platform specific elements
* Define, update, and ensure compatibility of SDKs, toolchains, and versioning to be used for compiling platform code
* Define Operating System and OS version support for each platforms
* Define minimum required drivers and libraries compatibility for each platform.
* Define platform specific languages supported.
* Create and manage first and 3rd party platform profiling and development specific tools.
* Write Profiling guide for platform operation and performance measurement.
* Create and manage scripts and tools for target platform specific packaging and deployment mechanisms.


## Cross-cutting Processes 

* Define implementations for extending system abstraction for platform device/os needs.
* Define or Approve shared cross platform libraries used.
* Advise how to integrate features into Platform Abstraction Layer but not responsible for the actual work.
* Create and manage platform OS low level subsystem libraries.
* Advise on how to optimize and use platform specific capabilities, but not responible for coding optimizations.
* Create and maintain platform specific asset type builders (Advise for Content Creation?)

## Out of Scope 

* Not responsible for system abstraction of device/OS implementations per platform.
* May advise but not responsible for fixing code incompatibility per compiler or platform.
