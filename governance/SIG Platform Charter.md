Two concise lines explaining what this SIG does with bullet points of the major responsibilities

- Responsibility 1

**Goals**

- Major goals that SIG seeks to generally achieve

**Scope**

Define platforms supported.

Define how Platform Abstraction Layer works
Define structuring of codebase for platform specific elements
Define all platform codenames to be used in code base
Responsible for ensuring noncompliant code for restricted platforms is accepted.
Define, update, and ensure compatibility of SDKs, toolchains, and versioning to be used for compiling platform code
Define Operating System and OS version support for each platforms
Define minimum required drivers and libraries compatibility for each platform.
Define platform specific languages supported.
Create and manage first and 3rd party platform profiling and development specific tools.
Write Profiling guide for platform operation and performance measurement.
Create and manage scripts and tools for target platform specific packaging and deployment mechanisms.

**In scope**

- Items that are the core responsibilities of SIG

**Cross-cutting Processes**

Define implementations for extending system abstraction for platform device/os needs.
Define or Approve shared cross platform libraries used.
Advise how to integrate features into Platform Abstraction Layer but not responsible for the actual work.
Create and manage platform OS low level subsystem libraries.
Advise on how to optimize and use platform specific capabilities, but not responible for coding optimizations.
Create and maintain platform specific asset type builders (Advise for Content Creation?)

**Out of Scope**

Not responsible for system abstraction of device/os implementations per platform.
May advise but not responsible for fixing code incompatibility per compiler or platform.
